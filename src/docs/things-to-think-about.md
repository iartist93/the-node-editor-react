### Zoom

- [ ] Now after editor pan/zoom correctly, moving nodes don't sync with the mouse position. The node moves more than the
  mouse dragged distance in zoom out and move less than the mouse dragged distance in the zoom in.
- [ ] what if the canvas contain many elements outside the screen? when scale down we should uncover them and they
  should be visible.
